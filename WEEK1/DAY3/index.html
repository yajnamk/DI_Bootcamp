        <hr>
        <p>One of my greatest acheivement, is to be part of the Student Union at 
          the University of Technology, Mauritius.  
          This has helped me to grow, took parts in different types of activities, communicate with 
          public and as well met great personalities. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I work well in a team but also on my own, 
          I like to set goals for myself to achieve as I'm 
          always up for new challenges. I have over 2+ years of 
          experience in the Customer Service Fields. My interest are mainly in
